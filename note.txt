- if we visit route '/profile' we are unable to view it, cause it is secured route, we need to be authenticated
- suppose we register as username: user password: password123
- then we login and we get our jwt token
- using that token we can view the '/profile' route

- but, here is the interesting thing:-
- if someone gets the token, no matter if he is registered or logged in with correct credentials or not, he can view that secured route
